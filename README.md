# Snake Game

A simple and fun **Snake Game** built using **React**. The game allows players to control a snake on a 2D canvas, eating food to grow in size. The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries of the canvas or runs into itself.

## Features

- **Game Modes**: Play in different difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your score during a session and compares it with the highest score (stored in local storage).
- **Responsive Controls**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to navigate the snake.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For the interactive UI.
- **Canvas API**: For drawing the game board, snake, and food.
- **Local Storage**: To persist the high score across sessions.
